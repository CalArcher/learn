Go ahead and read through these links:

* editors: _do code locally on your machine_

  * [Atom](https://atom.io)
* resources when lost:
  * do not trust w3schools.com, as I have found their information to be wrong on a few occasions

  * icons
    * [lineawesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome) ※ 
    * [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) - hard to get started without an account
  * fonts
