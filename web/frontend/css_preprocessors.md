## Start Here!
Welcome to CSS-Preprocessors! Above are plenty of links to help you get started.
Everything in this repository is free, and you should not have to pay for anything. 

* Getting Started:

  * Name (or rename) your css file to .scss_
  * [Install Live Sass Compiler for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass) â€»
    *You need the one by Glenn Marks; anything by Ritwick Dey is obsolete.*
  * Toggle 'Watch Sass' on the bottom toolbar of VSCode.
  
#### TLDR:

* sass is the preprocessor

* scss stands for sassy css and uses the native css syntax, so your css files can be converted to scss with just a rename of file extension

* everything you can do in css, you can do in sass/scss

* the reason to use scss instead of sass is because sass uses a different syntax. no squiggly brackets, and the like

* everything you can do in sass, you can do in scss
