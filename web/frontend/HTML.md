Welcome to HTML! Above are plenty of links to help you get started.
Everything in this repository is free, and you should not have to pay for anything. 

Go ahead and read through these links:
_※ - my personal preference_

* online playgrounds: _try code online in the browser_
  * [codepen.io](https://codepen.io) ※
  * [JS Fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)
  * [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/?html,js,output)
  * [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)
* editors: _do code locally on your machine_
  * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ※
  * [Atom](https://atom.io)
* resources when lost:
  * do not trust w3schools.com, as I have found their information to be wrong on a few occasions
  * [stackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/html) is a trusted source, but pay attention to answer dates
  * [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference) - Mozilla Developer Network
  * [JSinfo](https://javascript.info/)
  * [massive JS cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/)
